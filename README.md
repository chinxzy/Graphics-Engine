# Esmath-Graphics-Test-
A visual graphics display test of the Esmath  library in 3D space

The Binaries can be found in "bin\Debug-windows-x86_64\Opengl3D" Directory. 
Opengl.exe in the directory depends on content of the "src" directory to work properly. 
if you want to run the Binaries keep the Opengl.exe relative to the src folder. 
dont change the directories in order not to break anything.
